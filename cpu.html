		<h1>What is the CPU</h1>
		<img id="cpu" src="cpuintro.jpg" width="900" height="600" alt="picture of a CPU">
		<p>The CPU, also known as the Central Processing Unit, uses electrical currents to 
		represent 1 when on and 0 when off. CPUs are made up of mostly silicon, which gives it 
		it&rsquo;s ability to sometimes conduct electricity and sometimes to not, since it is a 
		semi-conductor. The CPU then sends this information made up of binary numbers to different 
		components, like the GPU, whose job is to decode the info then display it onto the moniter 
		for the user to see.</p>
		<h1>Intel CPUs</h1>
		<p>All Intel CPUs that are not server-grade have integrated graphics, or also called APUs. 
		This means most consumer chips can be used without a graphics card.</p>
		<h2>Code Names</h2>
		<p>CPUs have different generations. Each generation is different in it&rsquo;s own way, 
		bringing a performance boost with each generation. Each generation is given it&rsquo;s own 
		code name. The compatibility with previous generation hardware is not guaranteed, so it is 
		important to research before buying. Here is a list of Intel&rsquo;s code names and their 
		corresponding generation number:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Code Name</th>
				<th>Generation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Westmere</td>
				<td>1st gen</td>
			<tr>
				<td>Sandy Bridge</td>
				<td>2nd gen</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Ivy Bridge</td>
				<td>3rd gen</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Haswell</td>
				<td>4th</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Broadwell</td>
				<td>5th</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Skylake</td>
				<td>6th</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Kaby Lake</td>
				<td>7th</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Coffee Lake</td>
				<td>8th</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Each generation&rsquo;s naming scheme corresponds to it&rsquo;s generation number. For example, i7 7700k is a 7th gen processor. First gen drops the starting number, like i7 640M(List of Intel CPU microarchitectures)</p>
