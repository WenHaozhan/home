		<h1 id="top">Should You Build A PC?</h1>
		<!--This one has an id one because I wanted to make this paragraph stand out-->
		<p id="one">Why do people build PC's? Many people believe a PC is more powerful, reliable, and cheaper 
		 compared portable solutions like laptops. Moreover, it is fun to build a PC by yourself. Before 
		 we see if building a PC is actually cheaper than buying a pre-built computer, let's take a look
		 at the crucial components to the PC</p>
		<h2>The PC</h2>
		<p>The PC is made of a few but crucial parts. Some of these components include:</p>
		<h3>The CPU</h3>
		<p>The <a href="cpu.html">CPU</a>, also known as the central processing unit,is the brain of
		 the PC. The CPU can often be one of the most expensive parts to the PC, although there are 
		 many cheap options out there. 
		<h3>The motherboard</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard">Motherboard</a> the a circuit board that houses all of the 
		 pieces of hardware of the PC and includes all the ports to give the pc functionality.</p>
		<h3>The GPU</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a> is also known as the graphics processing unit, which renders 
		 the visuals onto the moniter.</p>
		<h3>RAM</h3>
		<p>The random access memory, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> stores temporary data and helps
		<h3>The power supply</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply">power supply</a> is the heart of the computer. It delivers power
		 the right amount of power safely to each component of the PC.</p>
		<h3>Storage</h3>
		<p>The storage stores all the applications and data to be accessed whenever the user 
		wants. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">hard drives
		</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">solid-state drives</a>
		(SSD)</p>
		<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>		
		<p>There are many other parts to the PC. This includes the case, fans and cooling 
		solutions, lighting, moniter, keyboard, and the mouse.</p>
		<h3>The Operating System</h3>
		<p>This is the only piece of software that is crucial for the PC to function. The 
		operating system, or OS, allows the user to access the applications and allows them to 
		navigate a friendly interface.</p>

		<p>So after we take a look at all components, let&rsquo;s take a look at some laptop and pre-built options at some different price points:</p>
		<p>For entry-level laptops, or budget options, which are around the under &dollar;500 price range, I have gathered a few options.</p>
		<h2>Entry Level:</h2>
		<img src="budgetlaptop.PNG" width="500" height="400" alt="A blue HP laptop">
		<img src="budgetlaptop2.PNG" width="500" height="400" alt="An ASUS Chromebook"> 
		<p>Chromebooks are nice for light use, which makes it a good option if you choose to take notes, 
		 browse the web, or watch videos. However, being Chrome OS, the computer comes with it&rsquo;s 
		 limitations. You can only download apps from the Chrome Store, giving a limited amount of 
		 downloadable apps. Chrome OS does not give the same amount of freedom as Windows, but it does come cheaper.</p>
		<p>For a PC that you could put together by yourself,the under &dollar;500 price range is a tight budget. Here, I have put together an AMD option.</p>
		<img src="amdpc.PNG" width="450" height="500" alt="Picture of all the components for an AMD desktop">
		<img src="amdpcpart2.PNG" width="450" height="500" alt="Picture of all the components for an AMD desktop">
		<img src="amdpcpart3.PNG" width="450" height="500" alt="Picture of all the components for an AMD desktop">
		<p>This is an Intel version of a budget PC</p>
		<img src="intelpc.PNG" width="1050" height="600" alt="picture of all the components for an Intel PC">
		<p>For a PC to funtion, there needs to be a graphics processor, more commonly known as the GPU. However, since the budget is tight, these APUs(Accelerated Processing Unit), which include both the CPU and GPU will work fine.</p>
		<p class="fineprint">*These PC are not fully functional yet. You still need to put in your own mouse, keyboard, moniter, and operating system</p>
		<p class="fineprint">*Note that I tried to choose only parts that were not on sale. You can easily find a better deal or find a more powerful PC for the same price if you fish for deals.</p>
		<p class="fineprint">*Components need to be compatible with each other to function. The prices may vary due to compatibility of different components</p>
		<p class="fineprint">*CPU, GPU, RAM prices vary due to their nature. Waiting for the right time when stocks are high can help save some money</p>
<		<ul>
			<li>For budget options, pre-built options are probably the best way to go</li>
			<li>Note, I did not choose any pre-built desktops since many at this price range are refurbished, meaning there would not be a constant supply</li>
			<li>I would suggest the AMD option that I put together because of it's powerful built-in graphics compared to Intel. The graphics can handle much more lower demanding games compared to Intel Graphics</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Consumer Level:</h2>
		<p>Consumer level is more expensive than entry-level (Ryzen). It can also be said that consumer-level is also the mid-range price, since it is just under high-end. I would say the jump from entry level to consumer level would have the biggest boost in performance and functionality. Due to the price range, it can be said consumer-level will be about &dollar;1000 in price</p>
		<p>Here are some consumer priced laptops:</p>
		<img src="midrangelaptop1.PNG" width="600" height="300" alt="Dell two-in-one PC with Intel i7">
		<img src="midrangelaptop2.PNG" width="600" height="300" alt="ASUS Zenbook with Intel i5">
		<p>Take a look at some pre-built desktops at this price range</p>
		<img src="prebuiltpc1.PNG" width="600" height="450" alt="Red gaming PC">
		<p>Now for the self-built PCs, take a look at the different component choices for this price range:</p>
		<img src="intelmidrangepart1.PNG" width="1000" height="500" alt="list of prices of an Intel PC">
		<img src="intelmidrangepart2.PNG" width="1000" height="300" alt="list of prices of an Intel PC">
		<h3 class="image">Intel pc</h3>
		<img src="amdmidrangepart1.PNG" width="800" height="600" alt="list of prices of an AMD PC">
		<img src="amdmidrangepart1.PNG" width="800" height="600" alt="list of prices of an AMD PC">
		<h3 class="image">AMD PC</h3>
		<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The slightly higher budget brings a huge performance upgrade, from Pentium CPUs to Intel Core i5 and i7</li>
			<li>The AMD side also saw a slight performance increase</li>
			<li>At this price point, theres is enough money to add a graphics card, which helps gaming performance, light video editing, and other more specialized tasks</li>
			<li>I would recommend investing in a mid-ranged PC rather than budget models</li>
			<li>Although a laptop has an i7 CPU, it is only 7th generation and has 2 cores. The PC has an 8th gen i5 with 4 cores, which has better performance</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>High End:</h2>
		<p>High end is anything above the mid-range price tag; however, I will not go all out. First I will show what you can build for under &dollar;2000, but this time being fully functional. The second comparison I will do is choose a few laptops with the most powerful hardware and see how much money it will take to build one yourself.</p>
		<h3>Under &dollar;2000:</h3>
		<!--The reason "Intel version" and "AMD version" are h4 here but h3 on top is because here they are a sub header of under $2000-->
		<h4>Intel version:</h4>
		<img src="intelhighendpart1.PNG" width="900" height="600" alt="list of components and prices of the PC">
		<img src="intelhighendpart2.PNG" width="950" height="600" alt="list of components and prices of the PC">
		<h4>AMD version:</h4>
		<img src="amdhighendpart1.PNG" width="900" height="600" alt="list of components and prices of the PC">
		<img src="amdhighendpart2.PNG" width="900" height="600" alt="list of components and prices of the PC">
		<p class="fineprint">note that gpu prices are inflated due to them being low stock. For some GPUs, they will be out of stock for a while</p>
		<p class="fineprint">also, I did not include a copy of windows in the price list. A standard copy of Windows 10 is about &dollar;160 not on sale. You can find goods deals for operating systems. 
		<h3>Price Comparison:</h3>
		<h4>Laptops:</h4>
		<img src="highendlaptop1.PNG" width="600" height="200" alt="Razer Blade PRO">
		<img src="highendlaptop2.PNG" width="600" height="300" alt="MSI gaming laptop">
		<h4>PC:</h4>
		<img src="expensivepcpart1.PNG" width="900" height="600" alt="list of components and prices of the PC">
		<img src="expensivepcpart2.PNG" width="900" height="600" alt="list of components and prices of the PC">
		<h2>Final conclusion:</h2>
		<p>As you can see, I did not cheap out on the high-end PC build, and it was still at least
		&dollar;1000 cheaper than the laptops, even with the operating system(I did not include it
		in the pictures). So in conclusion, building a PC is only profitable when you are going 
		for the high-end market. On the budget side, if you need a desktop, try buying refurbished
		desktops or some cheap laptops. For the mid-range computers, it would be based on personal
		preferences. If you ask "which one is better for yourself?", then you need to look at your 
		own needs. Laptops work on the go, while desktop PCs have better performance and reliability
		. However, on the high-end side of things, building your own PC can prove to save a lot of 
		money, but if you need that portability, you can never go wrong with a laptop.</p>
