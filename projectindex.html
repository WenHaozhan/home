		<h1>Should You Build A PC</h1>
		<p>Why do people build PC's? Many people believe a PC is more powerful, reliable, and cheaper 
		 compared portable solutions like laptops. Moreover, it is fun to build a PC by yourself. Before 
		 we see if building a PC is actually cheaper than buying a pre-built computer, let's take a look
		 at the crucial components to the PC</p>
		<h2>The PC</h2>
		<p>The PC is made of a few but crucial parts. Some of these components include:</p>
		<h3>The CPU</h3>
		<p>The <a href="cpu.html">CPU</a>, also known as the central processing unit,is the brain of
		 the PC. The CPU can often be one of the most expensive parts to the PC, although there are 
		 many cheap options out there. 
		<h3>The motherboard</h3>
		<p>The <a href="motherboard.html">Motherboard</a> the a circuit board that houses all of the 
		 pieces of hardware of the PC and includes all the ports to give the pc functionality.</p>
		<h3>The GPU</h3>
		<p>The <a href="gpu.html">GPU</a> is also known as the graphics processing unit, which renders 
		 the visuals onto the moniter.</p>
		<h3>RAM</h3>
		<p>The random access memory, or <a href="ram.html">RAM</a> stores temporary data and helps
		<h3>The Power supply</h3>
		<p>The <a href="powersupply.html">Power supply</a> is the heart of the computer. It delivers power
		 the right amount of power safely to each component of the PC.</p>
		<h3>Storage</h3>
		<p>The storage stores all the applications and data to be accessed whenever the user wants. These are hard drives or solid-state drives(SSD)</p>
		<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>		
		<p>There are many other parts to the PC. This includes the case, fans and cooling solutions, lighting, moniter, keyboard, and the mouse.</p>
		<h3>The Operating System</h3>
		<p>This is the only piece of software that is crucial for the PC to function. The operating system, or OS </p>
